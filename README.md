## Description
this cartridge is compatible with thomson MO5 64k cartridge
it's not a exact copy of the original cartridge<br>
but rather a rebuild from the manual
<br>
the $A7CB register controlling a MO5 64 cartrige is extended
to permit the access to 512k of memory
<br>
without the 3 jumpers the cartridge is behaving as the 
original thomson MEMO5 cartridge
<br>
with the jumpers set the cartridge can address 512k or memory
<br>

## Note:
The first goal of this board was to replace the original thomson board of 64K
<br>
with the use of modern chips it is easier to find a 128k or 512k chip than 64k
<br>
so I designed the 64k compatibility as the main feature and the extension
<br>
to 128k or 512k d√©pending on the ram chip used AS6C1008 or AS6C4008 as goody.
<br>
du to negative comment on forums saying that this extra memory is useless
<br>
I've listened this comments and removed the jumpers permitting to exploit
<br>
the extra memory.
<br>
As a few 512k board exist I let 512k test procedure and manual
but eagle files are now for 64k boards



## Control Register in $A7CB (without jumpers)
```
bits 0-1   bank number
bit 2      1 = ram visible
           0 = basic
bit 3      1 cartridge ram is readable and writable
           0  cartridge ram is readable and read only
bits 4-7   unused        
```

## Control Register in $A7CB (with jumpers)
```
bits 0-1   bank number
bit 2      1 = ram visible
           0 = basic
bit 3      1 cartridge ram is readable and writable
           0  cartridge ram is readable and read only
bit 4-6    extend the bank number
bit 7      unused
```

## PCB
the pcb can be ordered from oshpark<br>
https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/e0GleW5L

## Bill of Materials
* 1 x socket  dip 32  600mil
* 3 x sockets dip 20  300mil
* 1 74LS273
* 1 RAM Alliance AS6C4008
* 2 GAL Lattice 16v8D
* 1 diode 1N4148
* 5 resistor 10k    1206
* 5 capacitor 100nf 1206
* 1 block of 3 jumpers

## GAL programming
the GALS can be easily programmed with a TL866-II plus programmer<br>
GAL-16V8D-AC7B is going in the horizontal socket  (check the marking)<br>
GAL-16V8D-MO512K is going in the vertical socket

## GAL compiling
The .JED files are sufficent to build the board<br>
they can be recompiled from the .VHD by using:<br>
"Lattice ispLEVER Classic"

## Build of the board
the easiest is to solder the component in the following order<br>
1. 5 100nf capacitor (back of the board)<br>
2. 5 10k resistor (back of the board)<br>
3. 4 sockets<br
4. BC547B<br>
5. 1N4148<br>
6. jumpers<br>
